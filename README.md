## The Problem

When someone shares a link to your website on Facebook, LinkedIn, X (Twitter), or Slack, those platforms display a **preview card** with a title, description, and image. This information comes from special HTML tags on your page called **Open Graph meta tags**.

If these tags are missing or misconfigured, your shared links may show:

- The wrong title or description
- No image (or the wrong image)
- A generic, unprofessional appearance

This makes your content look unpolished and causes people to scroll past your links.

### Why existing tools fall short

You might think "I'll just use Facebook's Sharing Debugger" — but existing tools have significant limitations:

- **Platform-specific** — Facebook Debugger only shows Facebook previews. X/Twitter Card Validator only shows X. You need to check multiple tools to see the full picture.
- **Account required** — Most debuggers require you to log in, creating friction and privacy concerns.
- **Rate limited** — Free tiers restrict how many URLs you can check, or paywall you after a few uses.
- **Preview-only** — They show you what's wrong but don't give you the code to fix it.
- **Online-only** — They require fetching your live URL, which doesn't help when you're still developing locally or want to check changes before deploying.
- **Ad-heavy** — Third-party tools are often cluttered with ads and upsells.

## What MetaPeek Does

MetaPeek helps you **find and fix these issues** before they hurt your reach:

1. **Preview** — See exactly how your page will appear on 7 major platforms — all at once
2. **Diagnose** — Get a color-coded report of missing, incorrect, or suboptimal tags
3. **Fix** — Copy ready-to-use HTML code to give to your developer
4. **Fetch** — Enter any URL to analyze live websites, or paste HTML for offline analysis

### Platform Previews

MetaPeek shows how your link will appear across **7 major platforms simultaneously:**

**Social Media:**

- 📘 **Facebook** — Feed posts with 1.91:1 images
- 💼 **LinkedIn** — Professional network shares
- 🐦 **X (Twitter)** — Summary cards with large images

**Messaging:**

- 📱 **WhatsApp** — World's most popular messaging app
- 💬 **Slack** — Business communication link unfurls
- 💭 **iMessage** — Apple ecosystem previews

**Search:**

- 🔍 **Google** — Search results and Discover cards

Each preview component accurately mimics the platform's actual appearance, helping you **fix issues before sharing**.

### Why "MetaPeek"?

You're _peeking_ at your _meta_ tags — the hidden HTML that controls how your content appears when shared across the web.

### Who Uses MetaPeek?

**Content creators and marketers** who share articles, blog posts, or campaigns on social media and want their links to look professional and clickable.

**Web developers** who need to verify Open Graph and Twitter Card implementation before deploying, or diagnose why a client's shared links look broken.

**Communications teams** at organizations, agencies, and nonprofits who manage websites but may not have deep technical expertise — MetaPeek explains what's wrong and provides copy-paste fixes.

**SEO specialists** optimizing how pages appear in search results and social shares, checking title/description lengths and image requirements.

**Anyone launching a website** who wants to make a good first impression when their site gets shared.

### Why Is This Important?

Social sharing is often the **first impression** people have of your content. A broken or missing preview card can mean:

- **Lower click-through rates** — People scroll past links that look unprofessional or spammy
- **Lost traffic** — Your carefully crafted content never gets seen
- **Brand damage** — A missing image or wrong title reflects poorly on your organization
- **Wasted promotion** — Paid social campaigns underperform when previews look broken

Studies show that posts with proper Open Graph images get **2-3x more engagement** than those without. MetaPeek helps you capture that opportunity by making it easy to find and fix issues before you hit "share."

## CLI Tool

A **command-line interface (CLI)** is included in this monorepo at `packages/cli/`. It provides core meta tag analysis directly from the terminal with a **reduced feature set** compared to the web app.

**What the CLI includes:**
- 7-category weighted scoring (same scale and grading as the web app)
- Colored terminal output, Markdown, and JSON formats
- OG image dimension detection (PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP)
- Diagnostics with actionable fix suggestions
- LLM-ready copy block for pasting into AI assistants

**What the CLI does not include:**
- AI readiness checks (robots.txt, llms.txt analysis)
- Social media preview rendering (Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, X, WhatsApp, Slack, iMessage)
- Extended tag extraction (Facebook, article, Pinterest, Apple, Microsoft meta tags)
- Image analysis with per-platform crop previews
- Code generator with editable HTML output
- Export as HTML report

**Requirements:** Python 3.6+ and `jq` (install via `brew install python3 jq` on macOS).

### Setup

Add an alias to your shell configuration so you can run `metapeek` from anywhere:

**zsh** (`~/.zshrc`):
```bash
alias metapeek='/path/to/icjia-metapeek/packages/cli/metapeek'
```

**bash** (`~/.bashrc`):
```bash
alias metapeek='/path/to/icjia-metapeek/packages/cli/metapeek'
```

Then reload your shell:
```bash
source ~/.zshrc   # or source ~/.bashrc
```

Alternatively, symlink it into your PATH:
```bash
ln -s /path/to/icjia-metapeek/packages/cli/metapeek /usr/local/bin/metapeek
```

### Usage

```bash
# Analyze a URL
metapeek https://example.com

# JSON output (for scripting/CI)
metapeek https://example.com --json

# Markdown output
metapeek https://example.com --format markdown

# Show help
metapeek --help
```

The CLI exits with code `0` for grades A/B and `1` for C/D/F, making it suitable for CI/CD quality gates.

1. **Analyze Your Meta Tags** — Paste HTML or fetch a URL.

2. **Image Size Check** — See if your og:image meets platform requirements. Expand "Show crop previews" to see how Facebook (1.91:1), Twitter large (2:1), and Twitter summary (1:1) would crop your image.

3. **Platform Preview** — View how your link appears on Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, X, WhatsApp, Slack, and iMessage.

4. **Meta Results and Suggestions** — Diagnostics tab with color-coded status; Code tab with copyable HTML. Expand "Structured Data (JSON-LD)" in the diagnostics to check JSON-LD and basic schema.org validation.

5. **Overall Meta Tag Score** — 0–100 score with letter grade (A–F), category breakdown, and copy-ready issues for AI assistants. When you score a perfect 100, the "Copy for AI assistant" block is hidden since there's nothing to fix.

6. **AI Readiness** — Checks whether your page is prepared for AI systems (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, etc.) to understand and cite your content. When fully AI-ready (100%), the copy block is hidden.

7. **SEO Insights** — 10 advisory, non-scoring checks covering character encoding, favicon, viewport, og:type, image alt text, duplicate tags, hreflang, H1 structure, and resource hints. These don't affect your score but surface best practices developers should know about.

8. **Export Results** — Download JSON, Markdown, or HTML report. Expand "Raw HTML debug" to see the actual parsed `<head>` (useful when results seem wrong).

## Troubleshooting

### Native Binding Errors (oxc-parser, lightningcss, rollup)

**Problem:** When running `yarn dev` or `yarn install`, you may see errors like:

```
Cannot find native binding. npm has a bug related to optional dependencies
Error: Cannot find module '@oxc-parser/binding-darwin-arm64'
Error: Cannot find module '../lightningcss.darwin-arm64.node'
Error: Cannot find module '@rollup/rollup-darwin-arm64'
```

**Cause:** This typically happens when:

1. A `.yarnrc` file contains `--ignore-optional true`, which prevents native bindings from being installed
2. The `node_modules` folder was installed with a different Node.js version or package manager

**Solution:**

```bash
# 1. Check for and remove problematic .yarnrc
cat .yarnrc  # If it contains "--ignore-optional true", remove it
rm .yarnrc

# 2. Clean install
rm -rf node_modules yarn.lock .nuxt

# 3. Reinstall (without ignore-optional flag)
yarn install

# 4. Start dev server
yarn dev
```

**Prevention:** Never add `--ignore-optional true` to `.yarnrc` when working with Nuxt 4, as it relies on native bindings for:

- `oxc-parser`, `oxc-transform`, `oxc-minify` (TypeScript/JavaScript parsing)
- `lightningcss` (CSS processing)
- `rollup` (bundling)

### VueUse Functions Not Defined

**Problem:** Error like `useDebounceFn is not defined` when loading the page.

**Solution:** Ensure `@vueuse/nuxt` is installed and added to `nuxt.config.ts`:

```bash
yarn add @vueuse/core @vueuse/nuxt
```

```typescript
// nuxt.config.ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ["@nuxt/ui", "@vueuse/nuxt", "@nuxtjs/seo"],
  // ...
});
```

## Development Workflow

### Current State

All three phases are complete. For ongoing development:

1. Read `documentation/metapeek-design-doc-final.md` for design decisions
2. Reference `documentation/accessibility-guidelines.md` for every component
3. Check `documentation/phase-2-implementation-status.md` and `documentation/phase-3-implementation-status.md` for current feature status
4. Run accessibility audit before considering any component complete

### Testing Requirements

- **Unit tests:** 139 tests covering composables and utilities (> 85% coverage for security)
- **E2E accessibility:** 5 Playwright tests with axe-core (zero WCAG 2.1 AA violations)
- **Lighthouse:** Accessibility score must be 100
- **Manual testing:** Keyboard-only navigation must work
- **Screen reader:** Test with NVDA or VoiceOver
- **Linting:** Zero ESLint errors or warnings

Run `yarn test:all` to execute the complete test suite (144 tests).

### Accessibility Standards

MetaPeek **must** meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards:

- All interactive elements keyboard accessible
- Visible focus indicators (2px, high contrast)
- Screen reader announcements for status changes
- 4.5:1 minimum contrast ratio for text
- Color never the sole indicator (use icon + text + color)
- All images have appropriate alt text
- Form inputs have associated labels

See `documentation/accessibility-guidelines.md` for detailed requirements.

---

## Configuration

### SEO (Nuxt Site Config)

The `@nuxtjs/seo` module uses `site` config in `nuxt.config.ts` for sitemap, robots.txt, and Open Graph meta tags:

```typescript
// nuxt.config.ts
site: {
  url: 'https://metapeek.icjia.app',
  name: 'MetaPeek',
  description: 'Inspect, preview, and fix HTML meta tags and Open Graph markup.',
  defaultLocale: 'en'
}
```

The OG image (`public/og-image-v2.png`) is referenced via `defineOgImage()` in `app/pages/index.vue`.

### MetaPeek Config

All non-secret configuration lives in `metapeek.config.ts` (single source of truth):

```typescript
// metapeek.config.ts
const metapeekConfig = {
  site: {
    name: "MetaPeek",
    url: "https://metapeek.icjia.app",
    description: "Inspect, preview, and fix HTML meta tags...",
  },
  proxy: {
    externalUrl: null, // Set to external URL to use different proxy
    userAgent: "MetaPeek/1.0 (+https://metapeek.icjia.app)",
    fetchTimeoutMs: 10_000, // 10 seconds
    maxResponseBytes: 1_048_576, // 1MB
    maxRedirects: 5,
    maxUrlLength: 2048,
    allowHttpInDev: true, // Allow HTTP in development
  },
  rateLimit: {
    windowLimit: 10, // 10 requests per window (reduced for security)
    windowSize: 60, // 60 seconds = 1 minute
    aggregateBy: ["ip", "domain"], // Netlify aggregation
  },
  cors: {
    allowedOrigins: ["https://metapeek.icjia.app", "http://localhost:3000"],
    allowedMethods: ["GET", "POST"],
    allowedHeaders: ["Content-Type", "Authorization"],
  },
  diagnostics: {
    flagNoindex: true, // Warn if noindex present
    flagNoFollow: true, // Warn if nofollow present
  },
};
```

**Environment Variables** (`.env` - secrets only):

- `METAPEEK_API_KEY` — Optional Bearer token for proxy auth (dormant at launch)
- `NODE_ENV` — Set automatically by Netlify (development/production)

---

## Deployment

### Netlify (Production)

```bash
# Push to git main branch
git push origin main

# Netlify auto-deploys via git integration
# View build logs in Netlify dashboard
```

**Pre-Deploy Checklist:**

- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Lighthouse accessibility score 100
- [ ] axe DevTools reports zero violations
- [ ] Keyboard navigation tested
- [ ] Screen reader tested
- [ ] Security tests passing (Phase 2)

**Post-Deploy:**

1. **Test API endpoints:**

   ```bash
   # Analyze endpoint (GET)
   curl "https://metapeek.icjia.app/api/analyze?url=https://github.com" | jq .

   # Fetch endpoint (POST)
   curl -X POST https://metapeek.icjia.app/api/fetch \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"url":"https://github.com"}'
   ```

2. **Verify rate limiting:**

   - Test 11 requests rapidly (11th should return 429; limit is 10/min)
   - Confirm rate-limited requests don't count as invocations

3. **Test SSRF protection:**

   - Try internal IPs: `http://127.0.0.1`, `http://169.254.169.254`
   - Try private networks: `http://192.168.1.1`
   - All should return 400 with security message

4. **Monitor Netlify function logs:**

   - Watch for unusual patterns or errors
   - Check function invocation count vs rate limit triggers
   - Verify structured logging in production

5. **Test from different locations:**

   - Use VPN or proxy to test from different geolocations
   - Verify CORS headers work correctly
   - Test with various real-world URLs

## Security

> **Full audit available:** See [SECURITY-AUDIT.md](SECURITY-AUDIT.md) for the complete red team / blue team security assessment with proof-of-concept code and remediation guidance. A summary of all findings is also included at the top of the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

### Audit Results (2026-03-26)

**Overall Posture: GOOD** — 0 critical vulnerabilities. The application implements substantially above-average security controls for a URL-fetching proxy.

| ID | Severity | Finding | Status |
|----|----------|---------|--------|
| RT-01 | High | Chunked encoding bypasses Content-Length size check | Open |
| RT-02 | High | CSP allows `unsafe-inline` for scripts | Accepted (required by Nuxt/Vue; no XSS vectors exist) |
| RT-03 | High | Body snippet returns unsanitized HTML from target sites | Open |
| RT-04 | Medium | CORS only sets first origin from array | Accepted (dev-only; production unaffected) |
| RT-05 | Medium | No Content-Type validation on fetched responses | Open |
| RT-06 | Medium | Request IDs use `Math.random()` instead of crypto | Open |
| RT-07 | Medium | Error messages reveal network topology | Accepted (helps users; rate limiting mitigates) |
| RT-08 | Medium | `img-src *` in CSP allows arbitrary image loading | Accepted (by design — app previews OG images) |
| RT-09 | Low | Redundant `Cookie: ""` header | Open |
| RT-10 | Low | Rate limiting is Netlify-edge-only | Accepted (current deployment) |
| RT-11 | Low | `extractHead` regex lazy match edge case | Accepted (low impact) |
| RT-12 | Low | No server-side CORS enforcement | Accepted (API is intentionally public) |

**Blue Team — What's Well-Defended:**

| Defense | Rating |
|---------|--------|
| DNS pinning (TOCTOU prevention) | EXCELLENT |
| IPv4 + IPv6 private IP blocking | EXCELLENT |
| Redirect re-validation per hop | EXCELLENT |
| Timing-safe auth comparison | EXCELLENT |
| Script stripping in head extraction | GOOD |
| Structured logging with redaction | GOOD |
| Security headers (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options) | GOOD |

### SSRF Protection ✅

**Defense in depth approach (web app):**

- DNS resolution before fetch (blocks private IPs)
- Private IP range blocking (RFC 1918, loopback, link-local)
- Full IPv6 normalization and expansion (prevents bypass via fully-expanded IPv4-mapped addresses)
- IP-literal hostname blocking (rejects bare IPs and bracketed IPv6 in URLs)
- Cloud metadata endpoint blocking (169.254.169.254)
- Protocol whitelist (HTTPS only in production, HTTP allowed in dev)
- URL length limits (2048 chars max)
- Response size limits (1MB max)
- Timeout enforcement (10 seconds)
- Redirect validation (each redirect target is validated)
- Consistent Bearer token auth across all API endpoints (`/api/fetch`, `/api/analyze`, `/api/ai-check`)

**CLI SSRF protection:**

- Socket-level IP validation using Python `ipaddress` module (blocks private, loopback, link-local, multicast, reserved)
- Custom redirect handler validates each redirect target before following
- Host validation on both primary URL fetch and `og:image`/`twitter:image` fetches
- Protocol whitelist (HTTP/HTTPS only)

**Blocked ranges:**

- `10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`, `192.168.0.0/16` (private networks)
- `127.0.0.0/8` (loopback)
- `169.254.0.0/16` (link-local / cloud metadata)
- `0.0.0.0/8`, `224.0.0.0/4`, `240.0.0.0/4` (reserved/multicast)
- IPv6 equivalents: `::1`, `fc00::/7`, `fe80::/10`, `ff00::/8`, IPv4-mapped `::ffff:` addresses

### Rate Limiting ✅

- **Netlify edge-level** rate limiting (enforced before function invocation)
- **10 requests per minute per IP** (configurable in `metapeek.config.ts`)
- Rate-limited requests return 429 and don't count as invocations
- Paste-HTML mode always available (no rate limit)
- Aggregation by IP and domain

### Input Validation ✅

- Request body validation (strict schema, reject unexpected fields)
- URL validation before fetch (format, protocol, length)
- HTML sanitization (strip dangerous script tags, keep JSON-LD)
- CSS color value sanitization (whitelist-validated before DOM rendering)
- No execution of fetched JavaScript
- Error message sanitization (no internal info leakage)
- CLI terminal output sanitized against ANSI escape injection
- CORS `localhost` origin restricted to non-production environments

### Logging & Monitoring ✅

- Structured JSON logs in production
- Request correlation with unique IDs
- Security event tracking (blocked requests)
- Sensitive data redaction (tokens, keys in URLs)
- Netlify function logs for debugging

See `documentation/security-testing-guide.md` for comprehensive test cases and [SECURITY-AUDIT.md](SECURITY-AUDIT.md) for the full audit report.
